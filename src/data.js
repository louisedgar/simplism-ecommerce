      "Handmade ceramic bowl, made from black porcelain clay and hand-brushed with gloss glaze. Our ‘classic’ bowls have a straighter edge than our ‘pebble’ bowls, which are more flared and irregular shaped. This makes them suitable for a variety of dishes as shown above. Both style bowls will make excellent additions to your dinner setting. Each piece is created using a technique called slipcasting, where liquid clay is poured into a plaster mould.The outside of the bowl is left unglazed, creating a beautiful subtle contrast and tactility.",

      "Apsis is based on the circle’s most fundamental quality – rotational symmetry. The laminated beech wood body revolves freely around a limestone trey base, without the need for the complicated mechanisms commonly associated with adjustable lamps. In placing the bottom ring over the circular stone base, a basic bearing is created, allowing the lamp to endlessly rotate. The cable and LED components are hidden within the body and head, creating a clean, uninterrupted aesthetic that emphasises the lamp’s simple geometry.",
